# Training Content Updates - October 31, 2025

## Summary of Changes

### 1. ✅ Removed All Deliverable Requirements (20 files updated)
**Affected Files:** All `day1_practical_trainee*.html` and `day2_practical_trainee*.html` (TRAINEE01-10)

**Changes Made:**
- ❌ Removed: "Take screenshot of..."
- ❌ Removed: "Lab X Deliverables" sections with lists of screenshots/logs/files
- ❌ Removed: "Submission Checklist" sections
- ❌ Removed: Requirements for ZIP files, folder organization, email submission
- ✅ Added: Simple "Lab Complete!" confirmations
- ✅ Changed: "take screenshot" → "verify completion"
- ✅ Changed: "Screenshot of X" → "Verified X"

**Rationale:** Trainees don't need to provide proof of completion - learning by doing is the goal, not documentation.

---

### 2. ✅ Fixed Broken Navigation Links
**File:** `docs/index.html`

**Fixed Links:**
| Old (Broken) | New (Correct) |
|--------------|---------------|
| `day2_topic1_advanced.html` | `day2_topic4_advanced.html` |
| `day2_topic2_reporting.html` | `day2_topic5_reporting.html` |

**Impact:** Homepage now correctly navigates to Day 2 theory topics.

---

### 3. ✅ Clarified Integration Scope (Standalone Environment)
**File:** `docs/day2_topic4_advanced.html`

**Added Note (Page 95):**
```
📌 Training Note: This section covers integration concepts and architecture. 
Our training environment is a standalone Siebel system without external 
ERP/billing systems. Integration content is theoretical to help you 
understand how Siebel connects with other systems in production environments.
```

**Rationale:** Training environment has no actual ERP/billing integrations - content is conceptual/architectural only.

---

### 4. ✅ Clarified BI Publisher as Built-In Component
**File:** `docs/day2_topic5_reporting.html`

**Added Note (Page 122):**
```
📌 Training Note: BI Publisher is included with your Siebel installation 
and runs within the Siebel environment. No external integration needed - 
it's a built-in reporting component.
```

**Changed Text:**
- Old: "Oracle BI Publisher...that integrates with Siebel"
- New: "Oracle BI Publisher...embedded in Siebel"

**Rationale:** BI Publisher is part of Siebel installation, not an external tool requiring integration.

---

### 5. ✅ Created Missing Image Placeholder
**File:** `docs/images/bi_publisher.png`

**Action:** Copied `reporting.png` to create placeholder for `bi_publisher.png`

**Rationale:** Topic 5 referenced this image but it didn't exist in the images folder.

## What Trainees Will Do (Updated Approach)

**Lab 2:** Configure custom BCs/BOs in Web Tools, create applets, preview changes  
**Lab 3:** Import data via EIM, validate imported records, create service requests  

**No deliverables required** - Focus is on hands-on learning and instructor observation.

### Day 2 Practicals (3 hours):
**Lab 1:** Build custom reports with grouping, calculations, charts  
**Lab 2:** Create interactive dashboards with KPIs and real-time data  
**Lab 3:** Schedule automated report delivery via email  
**Lab 4:** Configure workflow for automated business logic  

**No deliverables required** - Trainees practice, instructors provide guidance.

3. Collect feedback on practical exercise difficulty
4. Note any broken links trainees encounter
