                Customer Relationship Management (CRM) is both a business strategy and a technology platform designed to manage all your company's interactions with current and potential customers.
            </p>

                <h2 class="sub3-topic-title">CRM as a Business Strategy</h2>
                <p>
                    Think of CRM as your company's "memory" – it remembers every customer, every conversation, every purchase, and every problem. But more importantly, it helps you use that information to build stronger, more profitable relationships.

                    <h4>The Three Pillars of CRM Strategy</h4>
                    <ol>
                        <li>
                            <strong>Customer Focus:</strong> Move from transactional thinking to relationship building. Instead of just selling products, you're solving customer problems and anticipating their needs.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <strong>Process Optimization:</strong> Streamline how your sales, marketing, and service teams work. Eliminate duplicate work, reduce errors, and ensure everyone has access to the same information.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <strong>Data-Driven Decisions:</strong> Use customer data and analytics to make smarter business decisions, from targeting the right prospects to identifying upsell opportunities.
                        </li>
