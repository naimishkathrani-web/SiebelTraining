                Customer Relationship Management (CRM) is both a business strategy and a technology platform designed to manage all your company's interactions with current and potential customers.

                <p>
                    Think of CRM as your company's "memory" ‚Äì it remembers every customer, every conversation, every purchase, and every problem. But more importantly, it helps you use that information to build stronger, more profitable relationships.

                    <h4>The Three Pillars of CRM Strategy</h4>
                    <ol>
                        <li>
                            <strong>Customer Focus:</strong> Move from transactional thinking to relationship building. Instead of just selling products, you're solving customer problems and anticipating their needs.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <strong>Process Optimization:</strong> Streamline how your sales, marketing, and service teams work. Eliminate duplicate work, reduce errors, and ensure everyone has access to the same information.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <strong>Data-Driven Decisions:</strong> Use customer data and analytics to make smarter business decisions, from targeting the right prospects to identifying upsell opportunities.
